        I had a problem while using an audio player: its scroll bar was small
        and wasn't comfortable when scrolling through my 10h+ long books. It was
        hard to be precise when scanning for a certain moment. I wanted to be
        able to scrub through an audio book for 10s or 4h in a convenient way.
        <br />
        <br />
        My solution was to design a custom scroller. Its width is equal to the
        length of a book in seconds, so the bar goes all the way off the screen,
        and it scrolls using the native iOS ScrollView â€“ which allows you to
        scroll both very slow and very fast with few swipes.
        <br />
        <br />
        This way scanning is joyful and easy for any amount of time: seconds,
        minutes or hours.
